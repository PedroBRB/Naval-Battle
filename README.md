Battleship Setup (in C)
This project simulates the initial setup of a Battleship game using arrays in C.
A 10x10 grid represents the game board, where two ships of fixed size (3 cells) are placedâ€”one horizontally and one vertically.
The ships are positioned using 1D arrays, and their locations are displayed on the board using nested loops.
All coordinates and validations (bounds and no overlap) are handled directly in the code.
